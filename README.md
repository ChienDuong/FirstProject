Project_Report: Businiess project_report summary of our work

Combine AutoCAD + C++code: I was doing on C++code, and my Labmate was reponsibility for AutoCAD part then combine two part together

You can find the following files in Final

CombineAutoCAD+Ccode is the final code:

                        Dataset       : .txt file
                        Code          : .cpp file

Some challenges We need to face when we were doing this project:

First: working this project on Matlab.

Second: Change Matlab to C++code because C++ is suitable for hardware

  I used vector to work on a big array data instead of using dynamic memory.
  
  I performed homography without opencv
